## What is the purpose of this Git repository?
From a personal perspective, this repository allows me to look back over the projects I've built in this class, examine the way they've built on one another, and look for additional ways that I can build on what I've learned to create new projects going forward.
In that sense, they also serve as the beginnings of a portfolio, although I will of course want to do all I can to build on that portfolio with new and more ambitious projects of my own.
Finally, in the same way that looking at this repository now allows me to trace my progress since the beginning of the semester, looking back on this repository in the future should give me a benchmark against which to measure how much I have learned and done after this class.

## Favorite Assignment
With the exception of the semester group project, which I've had the most fun with of anything in this class, my favorite assignment was assignment 3, the server for the private car service. I enjoyed deploying a web app to remote hosting so that it could actually be accessed from more than just my local system. Having to write verious routes also gave me a new appreciation for how some of the calls I had been making in previous assignments actually work.
My favorite lab was lab 5. Manually displaying subtitles was fun for me, given my background in subtitling using professional software, and it really helped me to get a handle on event listeners.

## How much have I grown from day 1 of this course until now?
To begin with, I think I've gotten significantly better at interpreting and applying information from online resources such as Stack Overflow in order to pick up new techniques without being explicitly taught them. I'm also much more aware of the technologies and methodologies that underly web and network systems I use on a regular basis. The unit on security toward the end of the semester really opened my eyes to a lot of issues and has added a number of concerns to the way I plan to approach design going forward. Finally, becoming familiar with tools such as Git and Heroku and working with a group to design and build a working project has given me greater confidence to work on my own projects going forward.

## What was the most important thing I learned in this course?
While skills like version control using Git are already proving useful in my other courses and I'm interested to delve deeper into a lot of the specific languages and tools covered in the course, I think my biggest takeaway will ultimately be the unit on security. It isn't a topic that any of my other courses so far have covered, and based on what I've been heard, I do not believe it will be a major feature of my remaining requirements. I don't think that it's something I'm particularly good at or understand particularly well, but just knowing how omnipresent an issue it can be and that I will need to consider it in future should be a major help to me in shaping my independent studies going forward. Even basic precautions like sanitizing user input and hiding API keys, etc. in my code had honestly never occurred to me before, so even the little I know now should help to make any application I build in the future much more secure than it would otherwise have been.

## What topic would I like to explore more deeply?
As stated above, I feel that it's most important that I gain a deeper understanding of security concerns for the platforms and tools I want to work with going forward.
That said, I tend to find my interest drawn to comparatively frivolous elements of any field, so I am most looking forward to experimenting more with tools for creating dynamic interfaces and doing more with media elements than I am currently able to. I would also like to experiment with a wider variety of frameworks than we covered in class to see what they have to offer.
